## Description

#### Problem

In order to write a news article on a trending topic, a journalist typically reads a lot of content, checks for the topic's relevance over time, and then decides which topic to write on. This process requires a lot of time, and context switching is also a part of the problem

#### Solution

The PulseSpotter project aims to assist journalists in the task of identifying newsworthy topics - topics that are likely to become popular, hence deserving attention. The system will collect the topics from various sources over time, analyse the patterns and make suggestions on which topics are emerging as popular.

The objective is to help journalists by saving time otherwise spent on news gathering, topic identification and also investigation on whether a particular topic is newsworthy enough.
