## Representing Articles as Embeddings

To begin, articles are transformed into embeddings based on both their **summaries** and **content**. 
This step involves **preprocessing** the articles by removing common stopwords to ensure that only the most 
relevant and meaningful words are retained.

Once the articles are preprocessed, they are converted into embeddings, which are vector representations that 
encapsulate the contextual meaning of the articles. These embeddings serve as the foundation for the next steps 
in the topic modeling process.

PulseSpotter uses an [open-source embedding model](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2) trained on German documents.

## Topic Modelling

PulseSpotter utilizes [BERTopic](https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/index.html) for topic modeling.
BERTopic is a state-of-the-art technique that leverages **BERT embeddings** combined with clustering 
algorithms to automatically detect topics from large collections of documents.

Each article is embedded into a high-dimensional vector space, and then clusters of related articles are formed, 
representing distinct **topics**. These topics can be interpreted as central themes discussed across multiple articles. 
BERTopic allows the identification of meaningful, coherent topics without requiring manual labeling or prior knowledge 
of the data.

## Topic Embeddings

After identifying the topics, **topic embeddings** are generated by aggregating the embeddings of all the articles 
associated with a given topic. By combining the individual article embeddings into a single vector, 
we create a **topic embedding** that represents the central meaning of that topic.

These topic embeddings capture the semantic context of the group of articles, and they are used as inputs for 
downstream tasks, including predicting which topics will be trending in the near future.

## Articles Count Trends

In addition to contextual information, the **article counts** for each topic are monitored over time. 
This forms a **time series** representing the number of articles associated with each topic throughout the week.
The fluctuations in article counts over time provide valuable insight into the popularity and potential 
growth of each topic. By analyzing these trends, we can make predictions about which topics are likely to gain 
traction and become trending in the following week.

## Modelling

PulseSpotterâ€™s predictive power comes from a custom **topic trends prediction model**. This model utilizes both:

- **Topic embeddings**, which encapsulate the semantic content of the articles, and
- A **1-week time series** of article counts for each topic.

To generate predictions, we use a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** network to process the time series data. The LSTM captures temporal patterns in the article counts, such as spikes or gradual increases, that indicate whether a topic might trend.

The output of the LSTM is then **concatenated** with the corresponding topic embeddings. This combined vector is used as input to a binary classification model, which predicts whether the topic will trend in the upcoming week (1 for trending, 0 for not trending).

This architecture allows us to leverage both the **content** and **temporal behavior** of topics to provide accurate predictions of future trends.
