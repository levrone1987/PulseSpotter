### Trending Topics Overview
This page lets the user choose from a list of weeks. By default, the most recent week is displayed and chosen for the
user. The purpose of this page is to give an overview of extracted topics and present statistics for ones which are 
outstanding in terms of the overall number of articles that are part of each topic.

![Trending Topics Overview](../images/screenshots/topic_trends_overview.png)

The page shows the most popular topics extracted from the underlying data. At the top a pie chart is displayed with 
a percentage-wise breakdown of the popularity of each displayed topic. Just below a list of topics is presented with 
information such as:
- The assigned topic label - Generated by prompting OpenAI's GPT model with a sample of articles for each topic and letting the model providing the topic summary.
- Number of articles - Raw number of articles that are part of this topic in the selected week.
- Link to topic info page - For each displayed topic a link is provided if the user wants to see more information about a topic.

### Trending Topics Predictions
This page uses a pretrained topic trends prediction model trained on custom data that is able to provide a prediction
for next week as to which topics are expected to be trending. A prediction is generated by using topics identified in the
previous week and then ranking each by a yielded trending topic probability score. The probability score is predicted by
the model utilising information about each topic such as the contextual representation of topics (a topic embedding
derived from embedding articles that are part of each topic) and a temporal representation of topics (representing the
trend of article counts through the week as an embedding). If you're interested in understanding the algorithm better
please visit [PulseSpotter under-the-hood](algo.md).
